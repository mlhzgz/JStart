JStart
======

**JStart** is a small library to help beginners in the Java language to develop their first applications with some support classes in basic topics like the console, dates and times, operating system and file management.

This library will be in constant development with new classes and fixes. The documentation in code will be completed as well. Includes a basic, simple Repository/Service pattern to access SQL databases also.

Greetings to all my students! Nice coding!
